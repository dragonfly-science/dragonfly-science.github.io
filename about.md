We are a specialist data analysis company, valuing excellent, innovative work,
carried out in an inclusive way.

Each of us has a PhD in a scientific discipline and significant experience in
our own field. Together we have a broad range of skills to draw on and apply to
diverse problems. We like the challenge of complex issues. Our research
backgrounds, and our expertise in software development gives us the flexibility
to tailor our service to the particular needs of each client.

Dragonfly Science was established in 2006 and now has eight staff. We work in
the heart of Wellington, New Zealand's capital.

We are committed to the scientific ethics of independence and integrity. We
support principles of openness in sharing results, engaging with peer review and
collaboration. Our aim is to provide the information necessary for robust public
debate and effective management, leading to better outcomes for society and the
environment
